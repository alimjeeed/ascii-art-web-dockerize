# ASCII Art Web Dockerize

**ASCII Art Web Dockerize** is an updated version of **ASCII Art Web Stylize**, now containerized with Docker for easier deployment and consistent execution. This project maintains the core functionality of transforming text into ASCII art while leveraging Docker for streamlined setup.

## Example Output

```plaintext
 _    _          _   _          
| |  | |        | | | |         
| |__| |   ___  | | | |   ___   
|  __  |  / _ \ | | | |  / _ \  
| |  | | |  __/ | | | | | (_) | 
|_|  |_|  \___| |_| |_|  \___/  
                                
                                
```

## Usage

1. **Install Docker**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from [Docker’s official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. **Pull the Docker Image**:
    Instead of building the image manually, you can pull the pre-built Docker image from the repository.
    ```bash
    docker pull alimjeeed/ascii-art-app
    ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
    Run the container using the image and map it to port 8000 on your local machine.
    ```bash
    docker run --name ascii-art-runner -p 8000:8000 alimjeeed/ascii-art-app
    ```

4. **Access the Web Interface**:
    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to access the ASCII art generator.

5. **Generate ASCII Art**:
    Enter your text, choose a banner style (Standard, Shadow, Thinkertoy), and click "Generate" to see the result.

## Implementation Details

### Algorithm

The ASCII-Art-Web-Stylize application uses an algorithm to convert text into ASCII art. Here’s a brief overview:

1. **Input Processing**: Validates the input to ensure it contains only printable ASCII characters.
2. **Template Selection**: Allows users to choose from various banner styles (e.g., standard, shadow, thinkertoy). The selected template is loaded.
3. **Character Mapping**: Converts each character to its ASCII value and maps it to the corresponding art lines in the selected template.
4. **Output Generation**: Combines the ASCII art lines to produce the final output, which is displayed in the web interface.
